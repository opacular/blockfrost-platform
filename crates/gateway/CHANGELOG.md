## Unreleased

### Added

- Per-relay `blockfrost_gateway_relay_platform_healthy`, `blockfrost_gateway_relay_platform_data_node_connected`, and `blockfrost_gateway_relay_platform_info` metrics in `GET /metrics` (and the same data points in `GET /stats`)
- Prometheus metrics endpoint `GET /metrics` exposing per-relay stats (connection status, WebSocket RTT, connected-since timestamp, request/response counters) and PostgreSQL connection-pool gauges (max size, open, available, waiting)
- Prometheus counter `blockfrost_gateway_http_requests_total` with `method`, `route`, and `status_code` labels for Gateway API requests
- `blockfrost_gateway_build_info` metric exposing the Gateway version and git revision
- Use a WebSocket load balancer to allow connections from behind NAT(s)
- `project_id` and `connection_string` can also be fetched from a file
- Required `database.pool_max_size` config value (overridable via `BLOCKFROST_GATEWAY_DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE`) that caps the PostgreSQL connection pool per gateway instance

### Fixed

- The underlying Blockfrost API error (e.g. rate limiting) is now logged when the license NFT check fails during registration

### Removed

- The TCP port reachability check during registration (and the associated `X-SKIP-PORT-CHECK` header / `SKIP_PORT_CHECK_SECRET` environment variable). It is no longer needed now that relays connect via the WebSocket load balancer.
